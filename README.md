# KillTheKing-Demo-
This is a concept demo for a text-based adventure about what the title says
Kill the King. 

This project was created in Twine to experiment with nodes and state switches.
The GUI that had for the program is pretty simple to understand and for people 
who know how to code can take move the limit of this engine. 

The installion is easy: Click the HTML file and it should open in your browser

In Twine, it allows for easy node switching by switching the state of a single website. 
You can point a node to go to another and have it point to itself, allowing you to refresh 
the state of one node. Things become easier to understand once you know things
happen if stated when to do it.

What I'm proud about this project so far is being able to collied both worlds of 
writing and coding. It allows to be invested into both of them at the same time and 
expanded on my skills and learn the ins and outs of creating a story for a game. I want this project to be one 
that I can come back to and continue to grow that story I've built.
